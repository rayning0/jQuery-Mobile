Just finished an intensive 6-hour class in jQuery mobile application development in Torrance, CA taught by Troy Miles. We learned about the code you need to create this cell phone application (http://tekadept.com/cc) that lists cafes near you and shows them on Google Maps. So much information! We only needed jQuery, jQuery Mobile, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to make this. No server side code.

===========

A Demo app for the jQuery Mobile Jump Start Class.
Ties into the YP Local Search API & Google Maps API.
Use iScroll4 for smoother inner scrolling and Handlebars for client-side templates.
This version is straight up jQuery - no Backbone or other framework.
